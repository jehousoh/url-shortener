# URL-Shortener

- This is a simple url-shortern built with react frontend (client) and nodejs backend (server)

# Lessons learnt

- This was my first time using nodejs hence I was able to learn how to handle fetch requests as well as how to link my frontend with my backend to communication and get/post data that I needed
- This was also my first time using mongodb and I learnt how I am able to create a schema and create a shorturl using a longer one
